- UFW check (sudo service ufw status)
 + UFW is a netfilter

- SSH check (sudo service ssh status)
 + ssh is a network protocol that give users a secure acces to computer over an unsecure network

- OS check (head -n 2 /etc/os-release)

-----------------USER--------------------->

- user check (mtellami) and check group belong to (groups)

- check password policy
 + create new user (sudo adduser <user_name>)
 + verefy password expire info (sudo chage -l <user_name>)
 + assign new user to sudo and user42 groups (sudo adduser <user_name> <group_name>)
 + explain how i set password policy (
    * need to install libpam (password quality tool)
    * password rules (cat /etc/pam.d/common-password)
    * password expire (cat /etc/login/defs)
 )
 + create 'evaluation' group (sudo groupadd <group_name>)
 + add user to group (sudo adduser <user_name> <group_name>
 + check if belong to group (sudo getent group evaluating)
 )

-----------------HOSTNAME AND PARTITIOM---------------->

- hostname check (hostnamectl)
- change hostname (hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>, sudo nano /etc/hosts (change hostname), reboot)
- how to view partition (lsblk)

-----------------SUDO--------------------->

- SUDO check (dpkg -l | grep sudo)
- assign eval user to sudo group (sudo /etc/adduser <user_name> sudo)
- show the limit of 3 try (sudo nano /etc/sudoers)
- show sudo logfile (in same file)
- show that TTY mode is enabled (in same file)
- explain secure path logic (bin:sbin)
- show the logfile (cat /var/log/sudo/sudo.log)

------------------UFW-------------------->

- UFW check (dpkg -l | grep ufw)
- check that its working (sudo service ufw status)
- explain the purpose of ufw
 + is software app that filter what is allowed to come in or go out from a network over ports, give full control of close or open ports
 + show open port(4242) (sudo ufw status)
 + allow new port 8080 (sudo ufw allow 8080)
 + delete the new port (sudo ufw delete 8080)

------------------SSH-------------------->

- check that ssh is intalled (dpkg -l | grep ssh)
- check that its working (sudo service ssh status)
- what is ssh and its purpose
 + is remote admin protocol allow users to communicate with server (authentication) (encryption)
 + encryption technique :
  * Symmetric ecryption (one key)
  * Asymmetric ecryption (use two key(public & private))
  * Hashing (dont need to be decrypted)
 + verify that ssh using only 4242 port (sudo grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config) (check in VM network setting)
 + connect with ssh (ssh user_name@hostname -p 4242)
 + check that you cant use ssh as root (ssh root@hostname -p 4242)

------------------SCRIPT-------------------->

- explain the script
 + header (#!/bin/bash)
 + what is wall
 + uname command with option
 + difference between CPU vCPU
 + free command with option
